This is my first react application.

This is a test job for Erply.

Assignment was: 

Please implement VAT number check using SPA framework of your choice (preferably ember, angular, react, etc..).
- Vat check must be performed against endpoint: https://vat.erply.com/numbers?vatNumber=BG999999999
- Create form for lookup and show results.
Example id for lookup: EE100247019


I'am not sure how long API endpoint is working. In 07.10.2018 it is working fine.

You can find working application here: https://kossar.github.io/erply-vat/

Just enter a VAT number with country code, at it will perform a API request and display's results. 


I know this application is far from perfetct. One week ago I didn't know nothing about react.
I learned a lot when doing this. And I feel my JavaScript skills has grown also.
